- Data Science: Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Supervised Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees), Natural Language Processing, Version Control with Git

## Projects 
I have developed over 20 programs in Python, showcasing my capabilities in various domains. Those that are representative of my journey are:
1. [Holiday](https://github.com/s-cassandra/Holiday-user-defined-function)
2. [Datasets and DataFrames](https://github.com/s-cassandra/datasets_and_dataframes_balance)
3. [Cafe](https://github.com/s-cassandra/Data-Structures_-Lists-and-Dictionaries)

## Career Transition
My decision to pivot from criminology and forensic psychology to technology stems from a deep passion and commitment to pursue a fulfilling career aligned with my interests. Overcoming societal pressures and self-doubt, I've found my calling in the tech industry. The challenges and triumphs of learning data science have ignited my enthusiasm, and I'm dedicated to contributing meaningfully to this dynamic field.
